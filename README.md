# PSTeachingTools #

This PowerShell module includes tools and techniques for teaching PowerShell.
Many of the commands will create a set of sample objects and commands that can
be used to demonstrate a variety of PowerShell techniques and concepts without 
having to worry about anything technical like Active Directory, services or 
file objects.

The zip file, PSTeachingTools.zip, will contain the most current version of 
this project as a PowerShell module.
